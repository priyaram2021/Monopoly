Design and Architectural Decisions:

1. Spring Boot Service:
   - The GameService class is annotated with @Service, indicating that it's a service component managed by Spring Boot.

2. Dependency Injection:
   - GameRepository, PlayerRepository, and PlaceRepository are autowired into the service using constructor injection, providing access to data access functionality.

3. Separation of Concerns:
   - The GameService class focuses on game-related logic such as creating a game, joining a game, and rolling the dice. It encapsulates these functionalities, promoting modularity and maintainability.

4. DTO Usage:
   - Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) like GameDTO, PlayerDTO, and ActionResponseDTO are used to encapsulate data exchanged between the service layer and the client, ensuring loose coupling and flexibility.

5. Exception Handling:
   - Custom exceptions like GameNotFoundException and PlayerNotFoundException are thrown to handle scenarios where the requested game or player is not found, providing informative error messages for better error handling and debugging.

6. Randomization:
   - Java's Math.random() method is used to simulate dice rolls, ensuring randomness in the game and providing an element of unpredictability.
